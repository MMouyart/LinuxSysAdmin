To list all devices mounted on the system : 
	fdisk -l 

To enter edition mode on a device : 
	fdisk <device>

Once in the edition mode : 
	type m to list all commands
	type p to list device partitions
	type d to delete a partition and enter the partition nÂ°
	type n to create new partition
		the partition can be p (primary) or l (logical)
		the partition size must be selected (generally after the last partition sector + new partition size
	type w to write changes made to the disk (CAUTION if mistakes have been made)
	type q to quit and discard changes
Once new partition is created to format it : 
	mkfs.<format> <partition>

To automate fdisk tasks, write them in a file, for instance :
	p
	d 
	w
	
Then use that file as input for fdisk : 
	fdisk <device> < <fdisk cmds file>
